General Description and Business Goals
Data Pipeline to store forest satellite images and weather data to better analyse deforestation causes

The goal of this project is to combine spatial image deforestation data with historical and contemporary weather data, which includes tracking average temperature and rainfall. We have initially focused on Indonesia, though there is potential for expansion in the future. Our goal is to enhance deforestation analysis by providing a data pipeline and dashboard that can be used in the future to inform future decision-makers to identify the most effective interventions would be to address the deforestation crisis.
